I am currently a Senior Research Scientist at [ABB Corporate Research Center](https://global.abb/group/en/technology/corporate-research-centers/usa)<sup>1</sup> in [Raleigh, North Carolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raleigh,_North_Carolina), USA. 

Previously, I worked for [HERE Technologies](https://www.here.com/)<sup>2</sup> from 2016 to 2020, first as a Senior Research Engineer and later as a Lead Research Engineer. Prior to that, I graduated with a Ph.D. in Computer Science from [Stevens Institute of Technology](https://www.stevens.edu/), [Hoboken, NJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoboken,_New_Jersey) in the summer of 2016. During my Ph.D. studies, I worked in areas including Computer Vision and Machine Learning (e.g., deep learning, convolutional neural networks) and multimedia signal processing. Prior to attending Stevens, I received my M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineeering from [University of Florida](http://www.ufl.edu/) in 2011. 

As a passionate engineer and researcher, I appreciate the opportunities to build a network with innovative individuals who share the interests in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Robotics.

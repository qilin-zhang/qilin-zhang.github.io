Welcome to the academic personal website of __Qilin Zhang__ (pronounced as [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet): \[t…ï ∞iÃå.liÃån  à ÇaÃÅ≈ã\] or \[ch'i lin chang\]), where I share my research progress in [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) (especially in [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) / [deep neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network)) with applications in [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision) / [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) / [signal processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_processing).  

My complete publication list is in the [üìö](https://qilin-zhang.github.io/publications/) tab, with links to full-text preprint PDF, [BibTex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX) files, etc. I also have patent applications and a short biography listed in the [üí°](https://qilin-zhang.github.io/patents/) and [üë§](https://qilin-zhang.github.io/bio/) tabs, respectively. My office address and email can be found in the [üìß](https://qilin-zhang.github.io/contact/) tab. 

In 2022, I joined [Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.) in [Cupertino, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupertino,_California) as a Computational Imaging Research Engineer. In 2020, I started working for [ABB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABB) - US Corporate Research Center (USCRC) in [Raleigh, North Carolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raleigh,_North_Carolina), as a Senior Research Scientist. Prior to that, I worked first as a Senior Research Engineer and later as a Lead Research Engineer for [HERE Technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_Technologies) in [Chicago, Illinois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago), where I worked on neural network-based machine learning algorithm design and contributed to the computer vision-based road feature perception for [autonomous driving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car). 

Prior to that, I worked as a Ph.D. student/research assistant at the Department of Computer Science of [Stevens Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevens_Institute_of_Technology). I was also fortunate to work as a summer R&D intern at [GE Global Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GE_Global_Research) in 2015, and as a research assistant at [University of Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Florida) before 2012. 

As a passionate engineer and researcher, I appreciate the opportunities to build a network with innovative individuals who share similar research interests.

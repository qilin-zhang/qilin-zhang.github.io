My name is __Qilin__ ([IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet): \[t…ï ∞iÃå.liÃån\] or \[ch'i lin\]) __Zhang__ (IPA: \[ à ÇaÃÅ≈ã\] or \[chang\]), and my complete publication list is on the [üìö](https://qilin-zhang.github.io/publications/) tab, with links to full-text preprint PDF, BibTex files, etc. I also have my patent applications and a short biography on the [üí°](https://qilin-zhang.github.io/patents/) and [üë§](https://qilin-zhang.github.io/bio/) tab, respectively. My office address and contacting email can be found on the [üìß](https://qilin-zhang.github.io/contact/) tab. 

I am a passionate engineer and researcher in computer vision, machine learning, and multimedia signal processing. In 2020, I joined [ABB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABB) - US Corporate Research Center (USCRC) in [Raleigh, North Carolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raleigh,_North_Carolina), as a Senior Research Scientist. Prior to that, I worked first as a Senior Research Engineer and later as a Lead Research Engineer for [HERE Technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_Technologies) in [Chicago, Illinois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago), where I worked on [deep neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network)-based [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) algorithm design and contributed to the [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision)-based road feature perception for [autonomous driving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car). 

Prior to that, I worked as a Ph.D. student/research assistant at Department of Computer Science of [Stevens Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevens_Institute_of_Technology), where I learned both traditional and [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning)-based computer vision. I was also fortunate to work as a summer R&D intern at [GE Global Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GE_Global_Research) in 2015, and also as a research assistant at [University of Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Florida) before 2012. 

As a passionate engineer and researcher, I appreciate the opportunities to build a network with innovative individuals who share my interests in  machine learning, including applications in computer vision, natural language processing and signal processing.

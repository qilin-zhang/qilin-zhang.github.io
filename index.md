Welcome to the academic personal website of __Qilin Zhang__ (pronounced as \[t Éi.lin. í√¶≈ã\], *i.e.,* Qilin {% include audio.html %} Zhang {% include zhangAudio.html %}, or more precisely \[t…ï ∞iÃå.liÃån. à ÇaÃÅ≈ã\] in [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) narrow transcription), where I share my research progress in [Computer Vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision), [Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), [Artificial Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence), [Computational Imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_imaging), [Computational Photography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_photography), [Autonomous Driving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotaxi), [Mapping and Localization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_map), [Image Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image_processing), [Video Content Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_content_analysis), [Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network), and [Signal Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_processing).

I am currently a **Research Scientist at [DeepNight](https://deepnight.ai/) ([YC W24](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/deepnight))**, building AI-powered night vision. I‚Äôm an **ex-Apple** Machine Learning Research Engineer, where I worked on computational imaging to improve the quality and functionality of images and video.

My complete publication list is in the [üìö](https://qilin-zhang.github.io/publications/) tab, with links to full-text preprint PDFs, [BibTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX) files, etc. I also have patent applications and a short biography listed in the [üí°](https://qilin-zhang.github.io/patents/) and [üë§](https://qilin-zhang.github.io/bio/) tabs, respectively. My emails can be found in the [üìß](https://qilin-zhang.github.io/contact/) tab.

Previously, I worked at [Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.) in [Cupertino, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupertino,_California) as a Computational Imaging Research Engineer. Before Apple, I was a Senior Research Scientist at [ABB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABB) ‚Äî US Corporate Research Center (USCRC) in [Raleigh, North Carolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raleigh,_North_Carolina). Earlier, at [HERE Technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_Technologies) in [Chicago, Illinois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago), I served first as a Senior Research Engineer and later as a Lead Research Engineer, working on neural-network-based machine perception and computer-vision-driven road-feature detection for [autonomous driving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car).

Prior to industry, I was a Ph.D. student/research assistant in the Department of Computer Science at [Stevens Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevens_Institute_of_Technology). I also worked as a summer R&D intern at [GE Global Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GE_Global_Research) in 2015 and as a research assistant at the [University of Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Florida) before 2012.

As a passionate engineer and researcher, I appreciate opportunities to connect with innovative individuals who share similar research interests.

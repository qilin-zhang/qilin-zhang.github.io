I am a passionate engineer and researcher working in computer vision, machine learning and multimedia signal processing. In 2016, I joined [HERE Technologies](https://www.here.com/en) in Chicago, Illinois, as a Senior Research Engineer in the Highly Automated Driving (HAD) team of the Automotive Division. We are consistently building and perfecting deep neural network based automated map building algorithms, to enable autonomous driving with our super high definition 3D maps. HEREâ€™s map is currently in use by major German luxury car manufacturers. 

Before, I worked as a Ph.D. student and research assistant at [Stevens Institute of Technology](https://www.stevens.edu/) in areas such as Machine Learning (including Deep Learning, CNNs), multimedia signal processing and Computer Vision, as a research and development intern at Computer Vision & Image Analytics Lab of [GE Global Research](http://www.geglobalresearch.com/), and as a graduate student and a research assistant at [University of Florida](http://www.ufl.edu/).

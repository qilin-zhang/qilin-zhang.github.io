##### AUTOMATIC LOCALIZATION GEOMETRY GENERATOR FOR STRIPE-SHAPED OBJECTS 
Qilin Zhang, Xiang Ma, Xin Chen, Sanjay Sood, Mark Tabb and Chen Luo, "Automatic localization geometry generator for stripe-shaped objects", US Patent 10,699,135 2020 [[Google Patents Link]](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10699135B2/en), [[PDF]](https://qilin-zhang.github.io/_pages/pdfs/US10699135.pdf?raw=true), [[BibTex]](https://qilin-zhang.github.io/_pages/bibtexs/zhang2020automatic.txt?raw=true)  
*Apparatus and methods are described for generating geometries for stripe-shaped objects. An image is identified that includes a roadway having one or more stripe-shaped objects. The stripe-shaped objects may include lane lines for road edges or lanes of the roadway. The stripe-shaped objects may include a barrier. At least one targeted region within the image is determined. The at least one targeted region is shaped to intersect the one or more stripe-shaped objects and includes a plurality of pixels. An image analysis is performed on the image to determine when the at least one target region includes a pixel in common with the one or more stripe-shaped objects. A geometry is constructed using the pixel in common. The geometry may be used to update a map or subsequently perform localization.*

I am a passionate engineer and researcher in computer vision, machine learning, multimedia signal processing and robotics. In 2020, I joined ABB Corporate Research Center in Raleigh, North Carolina, as a Senior Research Scientist. Prior to that, I worked first as a Senior Research Engineer and later as a Lead Research Engineer for [HERE Technologies](https://www.here.com/) in Chicago, Illinois, in the Highly Automated Driving (HAD) team of the Automotive Division, where I contributed to the design and development of customized deep neural network based automated map building algorithms, to enable autonomous driving with super high definition 3D maps. 

Before, I worked as a Ph.D. student and research assistant at [Stevens Institute of Technology](https://www.stevens.edu/) in areas such as Machine Learning (including Deep Learning, CNNs), multimedia signal processing and Computer Vision, as a research and development intern at Computer Vision & Image Analytics Lab of [GE Global Research](http://www.geglobalresearch.com/), and as a graduate student and a research assistant at [University of Florida](http://www.ufl.edu/). 


Previously, I graduated with a Ph.D. in Computer Science from [Stevens Institute of Technology](https://www.stevens.edu/) in 2016. Prior to attending Stevens, I received my Master of Science from [University of Florida](http://www.ufl.edu/). Please see my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/qzhang5) for more details.
